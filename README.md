# hax

Generate a zero-config Hacky Hackpecker setup using `i3-gaps`, `conky` and `polybar`.

## Install

Installation's made easy by the `Makefile`.

```sh
make install
```

Add `~/bin` to your `PATH` as that's where hax is installed to.

## Usage

Once installed, run `hax -h` for details on how to use it.

Or run it with the defaults with `hax`, but read the notes below first.

**:warning: WARNING** When ran, `hax` will overwrite the files listed below, so you might want to back those up first. Otherwise you might hate me for the rest of your life.

* ~/.config/polybar/config
* ~/.config/i3/config
* ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf *unless another terminal's specified in the options*
* ~/.xinitrc
* ~/.Xresources

### Terminal

The default terminal used by `hax` is *kitty*, for which a config is generated.
You can easily specify another terminal of your choice instead.

```sh
# Use st - suckless simple terminal
hax -t "st"
```
Note however that *kitty* is currently the only terminal for which a config is generated, meaning that you'll have to either edit the script, or create the config manually, if you decide to use another terminal. This is easily done though.

## Font

The font used in the screenshots is `JetBrains Mono` which you'll find [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

## Other dependencies

* i3-gaps
* polybar
* conky
* xsetroot (used by `hax` and `~/.xinitrc` to set background color)
* pacman (Arch Linux) (for conky package manager details)
* pamixer (for i3 volume control and conky volume details)
* xbacklight (for i3 brightness control and conky brightness details)
* ... Perhaps something else I've forgotten to mention

## Notes

The widths, heights, paddings, and offsets for `conky` and `i3` and `polybar` etc are *mostly* hard coded, meaning they won't work very well on varying screen sizes. Unless of course your screen size happens to match mine exactly. I'm on a `3200x1800` pixel screen, so you'll have to fiddle around with the configs to suit your needs.

This can all be made dynamic of course, at least to *some* extent. The tricky part, or one of them at least, is getting the conky panels to match the screen's height (we want them full height - no more, no less). But fixing all that to happen automagically is not something I'll be looking into right now.

With some fiddling you'll be able to adjust the conky, i3 and polybar config details in `hax` to suit your screen, I hope.

## FAQ

> "This is a joke, right?"

Not necessarily. Although I lean towards [simpler setups](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/hgtrf8/sowm_emerald/), this type of visually hectic setups apparently float some people's boats. So I thought I'd put together something they might want to use.
